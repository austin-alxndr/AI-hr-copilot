This Python program is designed to calculate taxes based on monthly salary, marriage status, and number of dependencies. Additionally, it includes a feature to calculate the required monthly salary to achieve a desired nett salary, considering the same factors.

## Features

- **Tax Calculation**: Calculate the gross salary, tax rate, salary tax, and nett salary based on the user's monthly salary, marriage status, and number of dependencies.
- **Required Monthly Salary Calculation**: Determine the monthly salary needed to achieve a specific nett salary, taking into account the user's marriage status and number of dependencies.

## Setup and Installation

## Customization
